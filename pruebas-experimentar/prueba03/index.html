          ><strong>WinMD5Free</strong> is a tiny and fast utility to compute MD5
          hash value for files. It works with Microsoft Windows 98, 2000, XP,
          Vista, and Windows 7/8/10/11.</span

          >As an Internet standard (RFC 1321), MD5 has been used in a wide
          variety of security applications, and is also commonly used to check
          the integrity of file, and verify download. WinMD5 is a small and easy
          tool to calculate md5 hash or checksum for different files (including
          files larger than 4 GB).</span

      <span class="STYLE2">Features:</span>
      <ul class="STYLE1">
        <li>
          Supports almost all Windows platforms including Microsoft Windows XP,
          Vista, Windows 7, 8, 10, and Windows 11.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fast and multi-threaded. It can compute a 2 GB file less than 1
          minute.
        </li>
        <li>Supports big files larger than 4 GB.</li>
        <li>Low resource usage. It uses less than 5 MB RAM.</li>
        <li>
          Don’t require .NET runtime installed. It is a standalone EXE file and
          the startup is speedy. There are MD5 tools for Windows on the market,
          but most of them requires .NET runtime and they may take a few seconds
          to start. This is also the reason I wrote the program.
        </li>
        <li>
          Supports “Drag &amp; Drop”. You may either select a file, or drag and
          drop a file to the program window to get the MD5 hash value.
        </li>
        <li>
          Supports verification of original MD5 value and current MD5 value.
        </li>
        <li>Most important, it is FREE. No spyware or adware bundle.</li>
        <li>Small size, an effective and tiny tool for data security.</li>
      </ul>
